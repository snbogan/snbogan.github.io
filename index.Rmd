### Welcome <a id="about_me"></a>

I'm an evolutionary biologist integrating physiology and genomics to understand the drivers and limits of environmental adaptation and acclimation. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the [Kelley Lab](https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/) where I'm studying the evolution of antifreeze proteins in polar fishes through the lens of structural genomic variation. I received my PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in the [Hofmann Lab](https://www.hofmannlab.com/), where I studied the evolution and regulation of plastic responses to global change.

### Recent news <a id="about_me"></a>
May 26th, 2025 - In collaboration with the Resources for Inclusive Eduction in Evolution (RIE2) Working Group, colleagues and I have published an open-source teaching module and lesson plan for lecturing on the evolutionary biology of phenotypic plasticity. Find our [module here on QUBES](https://qubeshub.org/publications/5396/about/3) along with [RIE2's other modules](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/rie2/teaching_modules).
