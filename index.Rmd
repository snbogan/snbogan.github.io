### Welcome <a id="about_me"></a>

I'm an evolutionary biologist integrating physiology and genomics to understand the drivers and limits of environmental adaptation and acclimation. I study how the structure and variation of genomes and epigenomes constrains or facilitates adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity at molecular and organismal levels.     

As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the [Kelley Lab](https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/), I'm studying the evolution of antifreeze proteins in polar fishes at macro- and micro-evolutionary scales through the lens of structural genomic variation. I completed my PhD at UC Santa Barbara where I studied the evolution and regulation of thermal acclimation.
